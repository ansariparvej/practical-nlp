    "We can see a timeline of each visit to the clinic or hospital. It’s accompanied by a word cloud of important medical conditions for the patient in the given time range. The user can drill down to detailed notes and history if needed as well. All of this is also supported by summaries of each report so a user can get the gist of a patient’s medical history quickly. HARVEST is much more than a reformatted novelty—it’s extremely useful for giving not just doctors, but also general medical staff and caregivers, a near real-time, informative snapshot of what’s going on with a patient.\n",

    "HARVEST delivers understandable summaries and conclusions by collating a patient’s history of healthcare issues across their lifetime. Its unique selling point is that it can mine, extract, and visually present content at a macro level—based on detailed micro-level observations—irrespective of where and by whom in the hospital a patient might have been seen. Such systems can be built to visualize and analyze a large amount of information. When the underlying knowledge base is unstructured text, as it is in the case of EHRs, NLP techniques play a key role in such analytics and information visualization tools.\n",

    "# Question Anwering for Health\n",
    "\n",
    "Our focus here is on the nuances of questions that arise specifically in healthcare scenarios. For example, these questions can include:\n",
    "- What dosage of a particular medicine is a patient required to take?\n",
    "- For what ailment is a particular medication taken?\n",
    "- What were the results of a medical test?\n",
    "- By how much was the result of a medical test out of range for a given test date?\n",
    "- What lab test confirmed a particular disease?\n",
    "\n",
    "To create such datasets of questions and answers and build a QA system on them, a general question-answering dataset creation framework consists of:\n",
    "1. Collecting domain-specific questions and then normalizing them. For instance, a patient’s treatment can be asked about in multiple ways, like, “How was the problem managed?” or “What was done to correct the patient’s problem?” These all have to be normalized in the same logical form.\n",
    "2. Question templates are mapped with expert domain knowledge and logical forms are assigned to them. The question template is an abstract question. For example, for a certain type of question, we expect a number or a medication type as a response. More concretely, a question template is “What is the dosage of medication?”, which then maps to an exact question, like, “What is the dosage of Nitroglycerin?” This question is of a logical form that expects a dosage as response.\n",
    "3. Existing annotations and the information collected in (1) and (2) are used to create a range of question-and-answer pairs. Here, already available information like NE tags as well as answer types linked to the logical form are used to bootstrap data. This step is especially relevant, as it reduces the manual effort needed in the creation of the QA dataset.\n",

    "# Outcome Prediction and Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "Health outcomes are a set of attributes that explain the consequences of a disease for a patient. They include how fast and how completely a patient recovers. They’re also important in measuring efficacies of different treatments. This [work](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/05/deep-learning-for-electronic-health.html) is a joint collaboration between Google AI, Stanford Medicine, and UCSF.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another focus of scalable and accurate deep learning with electronic health records is to ensure that we can build models and systems that can be both scalable as well as highly accurate. Scalability is necessary, as healthcare has a diverse set of inputs—data collected from one hospital or department can be different from another. So it should be simple to train the system for a different outcome or different hospital. It’s necessary to be accurate in order not to raise too many false alarms; the need for accuracy is obvious in the healthcare industry, where people’s lives are on the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s important in healthcare that models are interpretable. In other words, they should pinpoint why they suggested a particular outcome. Without interpretability, it’s hard for doctors to accommodate the results in their diagnosis. To achieve this, attention, a concept in deep learning, is used to understand what data points and incidents are most important for an outcome.\n",
