    "One way to build an MVP is to start looking at the markup structure of the websites. Generally, the questions and answers are distinguished using different HTML elements. Collecting this information and using it specifically to build an index of questionâ€“answer pairs will get us started on a question-answering system for this task. The next step could be using text embeddings and performing a similarity-based search using Elasticsearch.\n",
