    "A common approach to building recommendation systems is a method called **collaborative filtering**. It shows recommendations to users based on their past history and on what users with similar profiles preferred in the past. For example, Netflix recommendations use this type of approach at a large scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, there are **content-based recommendation systems**. An example of one such recommendation is the “related articles” feature on newspaper websites."

    "-  We may have to consider aspects beyond text in many applications where we need to provide more personalized recommendations or where other non-textual aspects of the item need to be considered.\n",
    "- In a real-world project, the impact of recommendations can be measured by \n",
    "    - Performance indicators, such as user click-through rates, conversion into a purchase (if relevant), customer engagement on the website, etc.\n",
    "    -  A/B tests where different groups of users are exposed to different recommendations are used to compare these performance indicators\n",
    "    - Conduct carefully designed user studies where participants are shown specific recommendations and asked to rate them\n",
    "- Our pre-processing decisions play a significant role in the recommendations served by our system."
