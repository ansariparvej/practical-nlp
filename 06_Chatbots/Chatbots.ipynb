    "# A Taxonomy of Chatbots\n",
    "\n",
    "A way of looking at these chatbots is how they interact with the user:\n",
    "- Exact answer or FAQ bot with limited conversations\n",
    "    - These chatbots are linked to a fixed set of responses and retrieve a correct response based on understanding the user’s query.\n",
    "- Flow-based bot\n",
    "    - Users may gradually express their opinions or requests over the course of conversations.\n",
    "- Open-ended bot\n",
    "    -  Intended mainly for entertainment, where the bot is supposed to converse with the user about various topics\n",
    "\n",
    "Two broad categories:\n",
    "1. Goal-Oriented Dialog\n",
    "    - The natural human purpose of having a conversation is to accomplish a goal via relevant information seeking.\n",
    "    - The goal-oriented systems are domain-specific, which requires domain-specific knowledge in the system.\n",
    "2. Chitchats\n",
    "    - Humans also engage in unstructured, open-domain conversations without any specific goals.\n",
    "    - A conversational agent must generate coherent, on-topic, and factually correct responses to make the dialog more natural."

    "# A Pipeline for Building Dialog Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Speech recognition\n",
    "    - The input is human speech.\n",
    "    - Then speech recognition algorithms transcribe speech to natural text.\n",
    "2. Natural Language Understanding (NLU)\n",
    "    - The system tries to analyze and 'understand' the transcribed text.\n",
    "3. Dialog and Task Manager\n",
    "    - Dialog manager gathers and systematically decides which pieces of information are important or not.\n",
    "    - The dialog manager develops a strategy via rules or other complex mechanism, such as reinforcement learning, to effectively utilize the information obtained from the input.\n",
    "4. Natural Language Generation (NLG)\n",
    "    - Generates a response in a human-readable form according to the strategy devised by the dialog manager.\n",

    "> Tip: Any chatbot can be built using such a pipeline. For text-based chatbots, we can remove the speech processing components. While the NLU and generation component can be complex, a dialog manager could simply be rules routing the bot to an appropriate response generator."

    "# Dialog Systems in Detail\n",
    "\n",
    "Terminology used:\n",
    "- **Dialog act or intent:** the aim of a user command, or in traditional systems, the intent is a primary descriptor.\n",
    "- **Slot or entity:** the fixed ontological construct that holds information regarding specific entities related to the intent.\n",

    "\n",
    "Dialog act classification is a task to identify how the user utterance plays a role in the context of dialog.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Tip: Building dialog act classification and slot identification from scratch can be a complex and data-consuming process. Doing so makes sense when our dialog acts and slots are more open-ended in nature than a Cloud API or existing framework can solve. Having complete control of dialog internals can yield better results over time in such problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identifying Slots\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we've extracted the intents, we want to move on to extracting entities. Extracting entities is also important for generating correct and appropriate responses to the user's input. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Tip: We can choose a range of ontologies for annotating entities. Imagine we’re building a travel bot. The choice of entity for the destination can be city or airport. To make it robust, we must detect airports as an entity since one city can have multiple airports. On the other hand, in the case of a restaurant-booking bot, detecting cities as an entity is probably suitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, in our Dialogflow examples, we saw that slots have to be pre-defined beforehand. But here, we want to build this component on our own using an ML algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "1. They need a lot of labeled data for both intent and entity detection\n",
    "2. We need dedicated models for both of the tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Response Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Generate an appropriate response. There are many ways:\n",
    "1. Fixed responses\n",
    "2. Use of templates\n",
    "3. Automatic generation\n",
    "\n",
    "> Tip: While automatic generation is robust, template generation has advantages over it. It might be hard to distinguish between the two, especially when the template variety is high, Template-based responses contain fewer grammatical errors and are easier to train."

End-to-end models are efficient to train, but they may not be reliable in producing factually correct outputs. Hence, a hybrid system with the combination of end-to-end dialog generation framework and with human resources will be more reliable and robust.\n"
